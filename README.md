Open Science_Transparent, Accessible and Reproducible Work

This open lab notebook contains analyses and products of my postdoctoral research in the Mass Lab https://sites.google.com/marsci.haifa.ac.il/masslab/home?authuser=0/ at the University of Haifa, Israel. This notebook is platformed on GitHub and it is directly linked to GitHub repositories that contain further details presented in notebook posts. Supplementary Material for published papers and manuscripts in review can be found in their respective repositories under my GitHub account.

Credits: The realization of this lab notebook was inspired by the work of hputnam https://github.com/hputnam/Putnam_Lab_Notebook. This notebook is built with Jekyll Now, forked from Barry Clark https://github.com/barryclark/jekyll-now.
